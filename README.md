# js-test
Test for javascript skills

1. install and run bower
2. get all dependencies
3. run your environment in local

##Tasks
The goal of this test is to evaluate your JS skills. Open index.js and refactor the whole code to your most beautiful way.

Thing to include in your refactor:

1. Avoid duplications
2. Use coherent names in your variables or function. Use camelCase all the time
3. Make the whole thing faster by optimizing functions
4. Think OBJECT ORIENTED

Please clearly comment your code as we can understand what you are trying to do at each step of the script.

When done, do not commit on another repo/fork. Zip your file and send it back to us.

Good luck
