# js-test
Test for javascript skills

1. install and run bower
2. get all dependencies
3. run your environment in local

##Tasks
The goal of this test is to evaluate your JS skills. Open index.js and refactor the whole code to your most beautiful way.

Thing to include in your refactor:

1. Avoid duplications
2. Use coherent names
3. Make the whole thing faster by optimizing functions
4. Think OBJECT ORIENTED

When done, do not commit on another repo/fork. Zip your file and send it back to us.

Good luck
